# Virtual Art Gallery

**Project:** Virtual Art Gallery – `art_gallery.html`

## Project Description

A single-page HTML-only project that showcases a virtual art gallery containing at least five artworks. This project uses only plain HTML (no CSS or JavaScript) and demonstrates HTML structure, semantic elements, lists, tables, links, images, and text formatting.

## Features

* HTML boilerplate with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
* Gallery title using `<h1>`.
* Each artwork uses `<h2>` (or `<h3>`), descriptive `<p>` tags and relevant text formatting (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<del>`).
* At least 5 images with meaningful `alt`, `width`, and `height` attributes.
* Links (anchors) to each artwork and an external art website.
* Ordered and unordered lists (including `<li value="">` usage and list-type attributes).
* A comparison table for artworks (Artwork, Medium, Year).
* Use of `<hr>` and `<br>` for separation and line breaks.
* HTML comments describing sections of the page.
